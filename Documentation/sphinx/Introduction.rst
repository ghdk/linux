Introduction
============

Operating system is a fork of the Linux kernel version 3.19. The aim of this
project is to study computer architecture and provide documentation that
covers the areas of study. Such a study requires a kernel. At first I started
writing my own kernel, but soon I found myself using snippets from my own
code in the documentation. In order to bring greater value to the reader, I
decided to use instead the code base of a kernel with real world application.
Hence, this fork was born.
